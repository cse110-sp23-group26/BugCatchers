# How is AI used in our project?
### Pros of AI
- It is good at solving small, isolated tasks, especially ones which require it to match to a template or fill in a blank. 
- It is helpful for debugging logic errors or commonly encountered bugs when writing code.
### Cons of AI
- There is no consistent style for code that is generated
- It doesn't have the scope of the whole project, so it ends up writing buggy code
- Generated HTML styles are inconsistent with our branding and other assets
- Image generation is often lacking when generating images related to Nintendo

## What role does AI Play
AI should be used very sparingly, and the user who is placing the AI generated code into the project must format it so that it 
matches the other design patterns we have chosen for our website. The user must also understand the code that they are pasting
so that the number of bugs due to oversights in the generation process are reduced. Image generation is discouraged unless it can
generate an output that is indiscernable, or nearly indiscernable from an image that wasn't generated with AI.
___
tl;dr if you use AI, make sure that you format the code it writes so it is "clean" and don't use ugly generated images.
