# Reducing scope
Originally we had planned to have 3 methods of fortune telling with lofty expectations of how much progress we could make in a given amount of time. Because of this, after evaluating the amount of work we can get done in a sprint, we have decided to stick with one method of fortune telling instead, and make the feature as fleshed out as possible instead of spreading that amount of work over 3 separate methods of fortune telling.

In the case that we do end up getting to a state where the first method of fortune telling is as good as it can be, then we can move forward with experimenting with other methods. Otherwise, we should stick to only doing just the one form of fortune telling and make it as good as possible with our efforts
