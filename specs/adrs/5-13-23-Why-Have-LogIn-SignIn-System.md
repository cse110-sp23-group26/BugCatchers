# Include Log in and Sign in system (user account control system) in our project

## Context and Problem Statement

1. We make a completely local web page, why do we need to include a user account system?

## Considered Options

- Include user account system.
- Not include user account system.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Include user account system", The reason for this is as follows: We assume that our web page will run on a public computer, and that many users can reach this web page and interact with their own accounts locally on the computer. Second, the theme of our project is a social software, if there is only one user and it is completely local, the theme of "social" cannot be realized.
