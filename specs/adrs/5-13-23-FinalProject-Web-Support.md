# The website (final project) only temporarily supports the desktop version

## Context and Problem Statement

1. Do we want the site to support multiple device pages (e.g. mobile, ipad)?

2. Do we have enough time to support us to make the site support multiple device pages?

## Considered Options

- Only supports computer-side web pages

- Only supports mobile-side web pages

- Support computer terminal and mobile terminal pages

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Only supports computer-side web pages", After assessing the remaining time of the semester and the capacity and energy of the group, we decided that there is currently not enough time for the site to support multiple platforms. Therefore, we have decided to only view web pages from the computer by default for the time being. If we have enough time before the end of the project, mobile support should be added.
