Spring 2023
Created 4/20/23
Group Number 26
Instructor: Thomas Powell
Team Name: TBD

Communication Conduct:
- Communication will be done through Slack.
- We are only obligated to respond to messages between the hours of 9am and 6pm. We can message message each other after hours, though responses should not expected until the next day.
- Communication must be done respectfully with other team members. If any one person is not comfortable with someone's style of communication, then they can either message the person directly to respectfully let them know, or if the person doesn't feel comfortable talking to them, then they can message a team lead (or a TA).

Meetings:
- As of now, we will meet **weekly** from 4pm-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If this time does not work in the future, we will change it to make it work for most or all members.
- We are expected to attend a majority of meetings. At the absolute minimum, attendance is required for at least 1 meeting a week (with exceptions for extenuating circumstances). 
- If a meeting time consistently doesn't work for someone, they are expected to let a lead know so that the meeting can be rescheduled to a better time. 

GitHub Responsibilities:
- Most developmental contributions to the GitHub should have a corresponding issue that they are intended to fix. Issues should be created for every major addition to a project in the repository. 
- Project work is expected to be done on separate branches and merged into the main branch. Merge requests will be submitted by developers and linked to the issues they resolve. 
- Merge conflicts will be resolved by the team lead. 

Conflicts:  
If members of the group have disagreements or conflicts for any reason:  
- First, seek out a private resolution between the disagreeing parties 
- If the groups cannot resolve the conflict privately, then they should notify the group leader and the leader will mediate the conflict and guide a helpful discussion with other members. 
- If the situation rises to a conflict that includes the lead or is unable to be resolved through discussion, the TA needs to be informed. 

Purchases:
- If the group needs money for future assignments (or projects) (although this is unlikely), then:  
	- The spending plan is decided by the whole group (such as whether to buy, what kind of items to buy, the quantity to buy, etc.)  
	- Funds are supplied by the whole group divided equally. 

Working Conduct:
- If a team member is not consistently attending meetings or delivering work towards completing tasks, then it is the responsibility of the team lead to reach out to the person on Slack to check-in with them
- If the person fails to start working after coming to a resolution, then the TA will be notified for action to be taken. 
- If a team member will be unable to work for an extended period of time, they must notify the team lead of their absence. A TA might be notified to determine how this will affect grades. 

Team Roles:
- Design Lead - someone who makes/finalizes the overarching designs for any products we create.
- Secretary - someone who is responsible for keeping meeting notes.
- Project Manager - Someone who primarily creates GitHub issues and assigns work to different team members.
- Roles are loose and may be shifted around depending on team members' availability.
