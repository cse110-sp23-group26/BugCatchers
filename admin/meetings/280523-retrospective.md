## What went well
- Clarified the design of our final project
- Communication and teamwork
- Got started on project, so building off of it is easier

## What didn't go well
- File structure is confusing without documentation to people who aren't already familiar with it. This made contributing hard.
- Task assignment is not even. Some people took a lot more tasks, some people took a lot less.
- Group organization was loose, and not many people knew what was going on at any one point
- Code style and readability can be improved.

## Things to improve
- More clear file structure, so that people can contribute more easily.
- Add a more comprehensive README file that details different files and tasks.
- Code format and style is not uniform, should improve.
- Not everyone is on the same page, so improve syncing.
- Try to put comments on the code.
- Uneven task distribution.

## Action items by next sprint
- Integrate code prettification into the CI/CD pipeline
- Create many more GitHub issues of high quality
- Assign more tasks to people who don't have tasks if they do not pick one themselves
- Edit the README to clarify the project structure, how to contribute to it, and describe the purpose and function of each directory.
