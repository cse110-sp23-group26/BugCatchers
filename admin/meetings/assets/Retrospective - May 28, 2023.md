Technique: What Went Well, What Didn't go Well
===================================

What Went Well?
---------------
Add notes about things that went well in the last iteration.

- Clarified design (2 votes)
    - I think we were able to apply concepts from the previous labs pretty effectively to the design and implementation of our website.
    - our idea of what we were doing went down smoothly

- Good Communication/teamwork (5 votes)
    - I think some thing that went well is that we kept open communication throughout all of it and we kept adapting to the rate at which tasks were being done
    - The team organization and communication between teammates well pretty good.
    - We have a good communicaction enviroment without accuse
    - Team are responsive and each individual seems to find what they need to do.
    - For tasks assigned, everyone may finish pretty well on their job, and everyone pays a lot of attentions on the whole project.

- Getting started (0 votes)
    - We started development!!!
    - - got the website base down
    - We managed to get a bunch of the basic structure of the website down in this last sprint. At this point, the main tasks involve tying all the different parts together.
    - we now have code written, so changing it is easier


What Didn't Go Well?
--------------------
Add notes about things that did not go well in the last iteration.

- Code Style / Structure (2 votes)
    - The code quality is uneven, and some team members have few code comments
    - a lot of the code looks like it was written by different people
    - It was hard to find where to edit and contribute code wise on github, maybe make a markdown file explaining each file

- Group organization (5 votes)
    - not everyone on the same page
    - The group communication was very slow. Sometimes a message is sent out, but no one checks it out for several days.
    - There isn't a whole lot of organization between people working on separate components

- Start late/Uneven assign (6 votes)
    - We start the project pretty late actually, and tasks are assigned mostly voluntarily. This result in some people may do more work than others, and thus some people have only little work to do.
    - We always wait until the last minute to start doing homework
    - Once a task has been assigned, people would get a little sluggish and procrastinate until the last minute to do it. So the overall pace has been slowed
    - Some team members seldom or do not participate in group work
    - The group task distribution is not reasonable, some people take too much task, some people have almost no task

- Other committments (1 vote)
    - As I was quite busy for the majority of last week, I was not able to allocate enough time for my part of the project; next week I hope to do some more substantial work
    - I feel like I messed up mainly by lagging behind on my labs and not pulling my weight
