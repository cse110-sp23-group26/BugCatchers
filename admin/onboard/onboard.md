## The Process We Build The Repo (how your Agile practices were conducted)
- Auto build on push to the main branch.
  - To enable continuous integration and delivery, a build sequence will be triggered on push or merge on main branch.
  ![Build](build.PNG)
- Auto unit testing and E2E testing on push.
  - Change in Repo will trigger both the unit testing for each individual components and a E2E test to make sure app works as expected.
    ![Test](test.PNG)
- Linter is also used to ensure code correctness for continuous integration.
- Prettier is used for uniform code formatting and improved readbility.
- To enable fast iteration, we created a variety of issue labels such as feature request and bug with templates.


## The challenges
- Many people do not have the same free time each week, making it difficult to allocate appropriate meeting time
- Uneven distribution of tasks. Some people get a lot of quests, some people get few quests
- Without a reasonable, proper plan. We always start tasks at the last moment
- Insufficient understanding of the task. For example, our understanding of User Doc, Roadmap, etc. files are quite insufficient, which makes us quite confused when creating these documents and reduces the quality of our documents.
- Insufficient testing of the code. Our test cases are few and far between. We do not pay enough attention to this aspect.

## The victories
- Overall team communication is good.
- Everyone is working with full passion and highly focused on their own part, with great communication helps the connection between different sections.
- We didnâ€™t blame others because of the mistakes we made, which gives everyone a safe psychological environment, so that we can fully exert our strength.
- The project is not just an MVP, but with a lot of details considered inside, even with an Easter egg design.


## Suggestions
#### What the taking over team needs to do:
- Add more unit test cases.
- Add more special effects.
- Complete the E2E test.

#### Our unfinished features
- another fortune teller based on tarot cards
- Smarter reply
- Improve CI/CD pipeline (more specific here)
